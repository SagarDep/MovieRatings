## Contribute

Contributions are welcome!

To build the project, create `local.properties` in the base directory if it does not exist and add following line to it.

```
omdb_api_key=<API_KEY>
```

You can get your API key here - [OMDB API Key](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)

If you don't have an API key, you can use `omdb_api_key=""` and the project will use `PreloadedMovieProvider` in debug build. It will return search results for `thor` and `batman` only.

Flutter is a smart app that helps you decide what to watch on streaming apps like Netflix üé•! It shows movie ratings ‚≠ê on your screen making sure that you don't even have to search üîé for it. It's ad-free and promotion-free.

<b>Accessibility services disclaimer</b>

This app uses Accessibility services. Flutter uses accessibility services to retrieve and read the window content to obtain name of the movies when you're using Netlfix or Prime Video app. Once the title is obtained, the app will show its IMDb rating on your screen.

<b>What does Flutter do?</b>
 
Some of the video streaming apps do not show you ratings of the titles that you want to see, be it a movie, a documentary or a TV show. You would probably search it on Google or Imdb to make sure that it's good. Flutter makes your life easier by showing you the movie ratings directly on your screen without typing a single letter.
Flutter also offers a support for Text to speech and speaks out the movie rating which is very useful for someone with disabilities.

<b>Is that all Flutter does?</b>

That is the primary functionality of the app. But it has much more to offer. Flutter provides an in-built search to find new movies, TV shows to watch. You can create your own collections based on your personal choices, browse your history and keep a list of everything that you like. Keep up with the latest version to get the new features.
 
<b>How does Flutter work?</b>
 
Flutter is smart and lightweight. It uses Android's accessibility feature üìã to get movie names from streaming apps. It looks up the movie on the internet üåê, gets basic details and accurate ratings from Open Movie Database, and shows you the ratings on your screen instantly. Whenever you open a page of a movie or a TV show, you'll see the ratings on the bottom-right side of your screen.
 
Flutter is cool üòé. It doesn't ask for your contacts or personal details, bother you with push notifications. Flutter is active only when you're browsing the content on video streaming apps and it will sleep peacefully the rest of the time. Flutter cares about your privacy and does not send your personal information or what you browse to the cloud.
 
<b>How to make it work?</b>
 
Flutter is brilliant but you're the boss! You need to enable Flutter's accessibility in Accessibility settings on your phone. But there's an easier way. Open the app, click the button and it will open up settings for you. Enable it. Sit back, relax and enjoy watching your movies!
 
<b>Apps that Flutter supports?</b>
 - Netflix
 - Amazon Prime Video
 - Google Play Movies & TV
 - Support for other popular streaming apps coming soon!
 
<b>What‚Äôs the future of Flutter?</b>

 - Support for <b>Android TV</b>!
 - Support for more streaming apps - so that whatever you use, Flutter will be there to help you out with movie ratings!
 - We want Flutter to be your go-to pal for anything related to movies, documentaries and TV shows from ratings to recommendations.
 
<b>Concerns?</b>

Flutter uses Open Movie Database to get movie ratings so it is possible that it might not have the ratings of some not so popular movies.
Open Movie Database has ratings gathered from various popular websites like Imdb.
Flutter is not endorsed by or affiliated with Imdb.com, Netflix.com, primevideo.com or omdbapi.com
