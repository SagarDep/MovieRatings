    <string name="accessibility_description">Turn ON the accessibility for Flutter to get movie ratings while you\'re browsing. It helps Flutter to get the name of the movie from the app.\n\n
Once you turn on the button, Android will show you a dialog which will give you info about what Flutter will get access to.
But don\'t worry. Flutter is cool and believes in personal privacy and hence collects no personal data.\n\n\n
If you want to turn Flutter off for a particular app, click on \'SETTINGS\' on top and you can enable/disable Flutter for particular apps.
